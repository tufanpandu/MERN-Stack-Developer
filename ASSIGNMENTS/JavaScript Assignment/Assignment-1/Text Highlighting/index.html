     <p>Ancient India (circa 2500 BCE - 600 CE):
        Ancient India witnessed the rise of one of the world's oldest civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization, around 2500 BCE. This civilization had sophisticated urban planning and trade networks. The Vedic period followed, characterized by the composition of sacred texts known as the Vedas. In the 6th century BCE, profound religious and philosophical developments took place, with the teachings of Buddha and Mahavira, founders of Buddhism and Jainism. The Maurya Empire, led by Emperor Ashoka, promoted Buddhism across the subcontinent through his edicts.</p>
