# What are joins and why we need them ?

- In normalization we already seen how we normalize table with breakdown the table with single entities with each table . If multiple entities is store in single entites then it started showing problems.

- Lets take an example of company like Flipkart
  which have sales, costomer and product table.

- If you want to fetch or analyse data of flipkart company table age of costomer between 25-30years also what product they by and amount of sales is complete.

- for geting costomet age -> Costomer table
- for Product details -> Product table
- for sales details -> Sales table

- combain all the table we use "Join" and analyze
- **Join is a concept for combaining data from multiple table and give end-user to help any bussines requarment.**
- Join is actualy combin data from differnt table.
- **Need :** Join is need because require data is always not present in single table. If we work on RDBMS the it's important to known join.
