# What is the significance of data modeling and explain the type of data modeling.

## What is the Data Modeling ?

> User can easyly access the data from the data base So, that inside the database which logic and complexity is used all are abstract out this is called data modeling.

Data modeling is three types

**_1. High level conceptual data model :_**
DBMS show the data to the user as user want's to see the data an real world.This is the meaning of high level conceptual data model.

Ex:-

#### Entity Relationship Model (ER model):

ER Model is directly connected with real world entity where you have two kind of entity and each entity in real world have attributes.

a. Leaving (Human)

b. Non-Leaving (Car)

**_2. Record Based logical data model :_**

- Easy to understand.
- Representaion is like how data is store in computer.
- This model have different type.

#### a. Hierarchial Data model :

- This is parent child or Tree like model. So, data is represent in tree like structure.
- Each child have one parent but Each parent can have one or more child.

#### b. Network Data Model :

- This is complex data model this complex model is the form of hierarchial data model.
- In this case Parent can have multiple child and also child can have one of more parent.
- It is the form of complex graph structure.

#### c. Relational Data model :

- In relational model data is represent in the form of table like structure.
- This model have relationship between table.

#### d. Physical Data Model :

- How data is store physicaly in computer memory and how data can retrive data from memory.
- This ensure that how data is order or arranged in the computer memory.
- Also it ensure data types like name(String) or age(integer or number).
