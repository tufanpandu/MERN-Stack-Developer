# Explain 5 challanges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS.

**Challanges of file-based storage system**

1. **Data Redundency :**
   In file-based storage system same data is stored in multiple file which makes data redundency. As you known DBMS doesn't store duplicate data which reduce the data redundency.
2. **Data Organization :**
   As you known file base storage system you have to organize your file for easyly retrieve , query and update which is deficult to organize but in DBMS you don't need to organize data it's make easy to access data.

3. **Security :**
   file-based storage stystem don't provide any security so that user can access the all data which is we don't want to shear .But in DBMS provide security of data so that unauthorise user can't access your data and easy to give access of data which is we want show the users.
4. **Scalability :**  
   In file base system is for manage small data which make it is for user but as you grow your bussines and need to manage large number of data that's make deficult file base system . DBMS is have scalability because you can store data as much you want and because of you have less data redundency and security you can store large amount of data on it and can shear data all around the worlds.

5. **Data Intigrety :**
   File-base system is allowed all type of data you can't set constrin for that which make data inconsistant. But in DBMS you can set constrain so that if you want to recive procut price as number then you can set that.
