# Write a short note on File base storage system. Explain the major challenges of a file-based storage system.

### File Based Storage System

File Base storage system is a traditional approch where store data is managed and organized by individual file and directories.
Each piece of information is store in sepatated fiel which is typicaly organized in hierarchial structure.

### Key features

**Hierarchy :** In file based system data is store in individual file througs directori or subdirectories in the form of hierarchial model.

**Independently;** Each file is self contained with own structure and format.

**Direct Acesses :** It gives direct acesses to the file which is make some time issue.

### Major Challanges of file based storage system

1. **Data Redundency :** In file based storage system same data is stored in multilple file which makes data redundency and inconsistancy.

2. **Data Inconsistancy :** Here same data is stored in multiple file and you update the in one file then it's not change all file it's make data inconsistancy.

3. **Inefficient use of storage space:** Because of storeing same data into muliple file it make it inefficients and inconsistance.

4. **Data Scalability :** For scaleablity file base storage system is not suitable because if you store data in different file or folder the it's hard to access the data and share data.

5. **Security:** File based storage system has less protection of data .It's not give control who can access the data and what they do with it.

6. **Data Isolation :** In file base system if you often store data in multiple file then it makes dificulty to access data and shear data accross the network or system.
