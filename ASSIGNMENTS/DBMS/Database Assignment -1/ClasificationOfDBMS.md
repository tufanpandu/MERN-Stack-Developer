# List out the Differnt type of classification in DBMS and explain them in depth.

DBMS is classified in differnt type.

1. ### Based on Data Model :

   DBMS used different type of datamodel based on

   **_Relational Data Model :_**
   Relational Data model is current time most popular datamodel some of example of relational data model is **mySql** and **_oracle_**.

   **Hierarchical and Network data model :**
   These is the older data model which is shows like Hirerchial Tree structure or network like interconnected.

   **Object Oriented Data Model :**
   These data model is used for handle complex data structure based on object oriented consepte.
   Some of example is **O2** and **Jasmine**.

2. ### Based on Number of users :

   DBMS is classified in differnent type based on Number users

   **Single Users :**
   These type of DBMS is used for single user .
   this is for small or personal use where data base is only access by single users.

   **Multi Users :**
   These type of DBMS is current time is all bussiness and people because it's help full for large scale bussiness where multiple user can access the data and manage.

3. ### Based on Distribution :

   Data base is classified based on distribution , which refer to how data distribute accross the multiple location or server.

   **_Centralize DBMS_**

- In centralize data base data is store in single place from this place user can access the data.
- This method data is not safe.
- This type of database is usefull for small scale organization
- Centralize DBMS on of the most risky thing is if centralize data base destroy or showing any error the no one can access the data.
- It's may be less expensive.

**_Distributed Database_**

- In distributed data base system data is store in multiple location or server , which is user can access data accross the world using network.
- It's is expencive and in this current time it is used largely.
- In this case if from any one server is showing any error then it's not cause any error to other user and data can safe.
