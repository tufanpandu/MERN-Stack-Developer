// ================== Private Data ============

 /**
  * If your using public class then anyone can update the data  of class for that we use private class.
  * In private class no one can update the data of class out side.
  *  -- for create private data  you have to declear the variable name which data we don't want to give access the outside of the class.
  * --- for doing private we need to add "#" to the variable name . like #price
